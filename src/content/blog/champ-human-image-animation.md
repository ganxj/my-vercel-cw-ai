Champ stands at the forefront of human image animation technology, offering a revolutionary methodology that leverages a 3D human parametric model within a latent diffusion framework. This innovative approach enhances shape alignment and motion guidance, setting new standards in human generative techniques.

## Methodology

Champ's methodology revolves around the utilization of the SMPL (Simple Person Model) as the 3D human parametric model. This model serves as a unified representation of body shape and pose, enabling precise capture of intricate human geometry and motion characteristics from source videos.

## Key components of Champ's methodology include:

**SMPL Integration:** Incorporating rendered depth images, normal maps, and semantic maps from SMPL sequences, alongside skeleton-based motion guidance, enriches the latent diffusion model with comprehensive 3D shape and detailed pose attributes.

**Multi-layer Motion Fusion Module:** Employing self-attention mechanisms, this module facilitates the fusion of shape and motion latent representations in the spatial domain.

**Parametric Shape Alignment:** Representing the 3D human parametric model as motion guidance allows for precise shape alignment of the human body between the reference image and the source video motion.

## Results

Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets showcase Champ's remarkable ability to generate high-quality human animations that accurately capture both pose and shape variations. Moreover, Champ exhibits superior generalization capabilities on diverse datasets, including the proposed wild dataset.
